## This is a repository containing codes to produce plots in "Policy Design in Long-run Welfare Dynamics"

### All the required packages to run the codes are in "requirement.txt".

* "read_sipp" folder contains the cleaned data.
* "real_initial_linear.ipynb" generates Figure 1.(a) in the paper.
* "heterogeneity_compare.py" generates Figure 1.(b) in the paper.
* "ruin_condition.ipynb" generates Figure 2 in Appendix "Policy comparison under a ruin condition".
* "concave_functions.ipynb" generates Figure 3 in Appendix "Beyond a Matthew effect: modeling variations of the treatment effect function".
* "utility_funcs.py" contains code for computing gini coefficient, which is not presented in the paper.
