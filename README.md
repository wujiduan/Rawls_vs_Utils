# Rawls_vs_Utils
## This is a repository containing codes to produce plots in paper _"Policy Design in Long-run Welfare Dynamics"_

### All the required packages to run the codes are in "requirement.txt".

* "read_sipp" folder contains the cleaned data.
* "multibudget_real_initial_linear.py" generates Figure 1.(a) (set budget_num = 1) and Figure 1.(b) (set budget_num = 10) in the paper.
* "one_heterogeneous_compare.py" generates Figure 2.
* "heterogeneity_compare_pool.py" generates Figure 3.(a) and Figure 3.(b).
* "other_monotonicity_comb" generates Figure 4.
* "ruin_condition.py" generates Figure 5 in Appendix "Policy comparison under a ruin condition".
* "concave_functions.py" generates Figure 6 in Appendix "Beyond a Matthew effect: modeling variations of the treatment effect function".
* "utility_funcs.py" contains code for computing gini coefficient, which is not presented in the paper.
